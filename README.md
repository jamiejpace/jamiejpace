## Hi, I'm Jamie!&nbsp;👋

👩🏻‍⚕️&nbsp; &nbsp;Before taking the leap into software engineering, I was a registered nurse for seven years, working in oncology for the last four and completeing five travel assignments.

💻&nbsp; &nbsp;I’m currently learning Ruby at Turing School of Software and Design.

🍦&nbsp; &nbsp;When I'm not coding, you can usually find me curled up with a book, riding my bike, or on the hunt for the perfect ice cream flavor. 

📫&nbsp; &nbsp;I'd love to hear from you! Email me at jamiejpace@gmail.com or find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamiejpace/<br><br>
