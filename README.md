ğŸ‘‹  Hi, I'm Jamie! 

ğŸ§¬  Before taking the leap into software engineering, I was a traveling nurse, working at oncology clinics across 5 different states and 7 different facilites.

ğŸŒ±  Iâ€™m currently learning Ruby at Turing School of Software and Design.

ğŸ“š  When I'm not coding, you can usually find me curled up with a novel, riding my bike, or traveling somewhere new. 

ğŸ“«  I'd love to hear from you! Email me at jamiejpace@gmail.com or find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamiejpace/
