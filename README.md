## Hi, I'm Jamie!

👩🏻‍⚕️&nbsp; &nbsp;Before taking the leap into software engineering, I was a traveling oncology nurse. <br>
🍦&nbsp; &nbsp;When I'm not coding, you can usually find me curled up with a book, riding my bike, or on the hunt for the perfect ice cream flavor. <br>
📫&nbsp; &nbsp;I'd love to hear from you! Email me at jamiejpace@gmail.com or find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamiejpace/<br><br>
